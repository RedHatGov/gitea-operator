= Gitea Operator

== Overview

This repository contains the code to build a Gitea Operator for Kubernetes, including Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The Operator will create a *PostgreSQL* database and a *Gitea* instance connected to the PostgreSQL database.

It is implemented on top of the Red Hat https://sdk.operatorframework.io/[Operator SDK] - in particular the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/ansible/[Ansible Operator].

== Building the Operator

There is a script `hack/operate.sh` which will download the prerequisites (operator-sdk etc.), build the operator artifacts from operator-sdk defaults, package and push the operator container image, deploy the artifacts to a Kubernetes cluster, and create a `kind: Gitea` CR to deploy an instance. You should use the help page to look at what the various options do, but for the most part if you want to deploy Gitea to a cluster directly from this repo you could run `hack/operate.sh -d`.

Before running the script make sure to update the location of the container image to a repository you have access to. If you decide to build your own container image for the operator, make sure to update `hack/operate.conf` with an updated container image location and add the `-p` flag to `operate.sh`.

== Installation

=== Operator Installation Steps

The installation of the Custom Resource Definition and Cluster Role requires *cluster-admin* privileges. After that regular users with `admin` privileges on their projects (which is automatically granted to the user who creates a project) can provision the Gitea Operator in their projects and deploy instances of Gitea using the gitea.redhatgov.io Custom Resource.

Perform the following tasks as *cluster-admin*:

. Deploy the CustomResourceDefinition, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, ServiceAccount, and Operator Deployment:
+
[source,sh]
----
hack/operate.sh
----

. Once the Operator pod is running the Operator is ready to start creating Gitea Servers.

. To deploy the above, and also the `config/samples/redhatgov_v1alpha1_gitea.yaml` example CustomResource:
+
[source,sh]
----
hack/operate.sh -d
----

== Deploying a custom Gitea instance using the Operator

A Gitea instance is deployed by creating a Custom Resource based on the gitea Custom Resource Definition.

.Example
+
[source,texinfo]
----
apiVersion: redhatgov.io/v1alpha1
kind: Gitea
metadata:
  name: gitea-example
spec:
  postgresql:
    volumeSize: 1Gi
    image:
      src: registry.redhat.io/rhel8/postgresql-10
      tag: latest
  gitea:
    expose:
      ssl: true                                             # There is currently no way to specify an alternate certificate
      uri: special-gitea-route.apps.cluster.example.com     # You can leave this field out on OpenShift to get the default
      kind: Ingress                                         # This should be of kind Route on OpenShift
    image:
      src: quay.io/redhatgov/gitea
      tag: latest
      pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    volumeSize: 1Gi                                         # Only matters if `persistent: true`
    resources:
      memory:
        request: 2Gi
        limit: 3Gi
      cpu:
        request: 1000m
        limit: 2000m
  persistent: true

----

. Write the definition to a file (e.g. gitea.yaml) and then create the Gitea instance:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f ./gitea.yaml
----

. The operator will first create the PostgreSQL database, wait until it is up and running and then create the Gitea pod.
. Validate that both pods (postgresql and gitea) are running before proceeding.
. You can validate the existence of your Gitea instance by querying for gitea objects:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get gitea
----

. Get the Route for Gitea (the PostgreSQL database is not accessible outside of the project):
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get route
----

. Use the hostname returned in your Web Browser to open the Gitea UI (default User ID is `admin` with password `admin`).

== Deleting a Gitea instance

Deleting a Gitea instance and its associated resources is as simple as deleting the gitea object. If you created a Gitea server called `gitea-example` as in the example above it suffices to run the delete command on that resource:

[source,sh]
----
oc delete gitea gitea-example
----

The Operator adds ownerReference fields to all created objects - which means that deleting the gitea object also deletes all objects that have been created by the Operator.

== Uninstalling the Gitea Operator

In case you wish to uninstall the Gitea Operator make sure that there are no more Gitea instances running. Once all Gitea instances have been deleted simply delete the operator and its resources with:
+
[source,sh]
----
hack/operate.sh -r
----

== Notes on disconnected installations

The Operator SDK makes heavy use of Kustomize for development and installation, but intends bundles to be generated for use in an operator catalog. This enables the Operator Lifecycle Manager, deployed onto your cluster, to install and configure operators with a simple `kind: Subscription` object, instead of a large collection of manifests. If you intend on using `hack/operate.sh` it expects you to be in a development environment. Operator installation from this script therefore expects access to the internet. This comes with one extra concern: If `kustomize` isn't in your path, it tries to download it from the internet and save it locally into a `.gitignore`d folder. If you intend on using `hack/operate.sh` to install the operator, you should also bring `kustomize` and place it in the `$PATH` of the user who will be running the script.

To change the image sources for all necessary images for `hack/operate.sh` to deploy the operator, you need to have the following images hosted in a container repository on your disconnected network:

. quay.io/redhatgov/gitea-operator:latest
. quay.io/redhatgov/gitea:latest
. Some PostgreSQL 10 image that either behaves like the Red Hat PostgreSQL 10 RHEL 8 image or the docker.io/library/postgres:10 image.

The places where you must update those sources are then, respectively:

. `hack/operate.conf`: IMG should point to the gitea-operator image in your environment _before_ running `hack/operate.sh`
. The `kind: Gitea` custom resource manifest: `spec.gitea.image.src` and `spec.gitea.image.tag` should be updated
. The `kind: Gitea` custom resource manifest: `spec.postgresql.image.src` and `spec.postgresql.image.tag` should be updated
